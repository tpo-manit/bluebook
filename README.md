2. Create or install a theme:
   - Create a new theme with the command "hugo new theme <THEMENAME>"
   - Or, install a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/
3. Edit hugo.yaml, setting the "theme" property to the theme name.
4. Create new content with the command "hugo new content <SECTIONNAME>\<FILENAME>.<FORMAT>".
5. Start the embedded web server with the command "hugo server --buildDrafts".
