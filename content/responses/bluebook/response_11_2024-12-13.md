Technical Interviews:
In both of the technical interviews, there was a brief discussion on CS fundamentals (OOPS, DBMS, CN etc), some basic questions like what happens when you enter zomato.com on a browser where they expected a brief discussion on DNS, protocols involved etc. Gave a few SQL queries, and a question to design a system for effective management of zomato /blinkit drivers with respect to allocation of orders on live/ scheduling basis. Also there was an in-depth discussion on my projects.

In total 4 DSA questions were asked from Trees/Graphs, Pointers & DP. 2 of them were completely new(medium-high rated), other 2 standard (easy-medium level).

HR Interview:
Discussion on career and goals etc, management experience and other formal questions expected in an HR interview were asked
