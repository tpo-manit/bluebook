9. ### Online Assessment Round Questions

> {{< collapse summary="Expand" >}}

There were 3 questions, 
one was given a street with x points, find the minimum number of lights to illuminate all points given each lamp can illuminate an arc of Y length, this is on leetcode and is binary serach, the idea is to place lamps to the rightmost point possible everytime to maximize their utility.
I can't recall the other two questions but one was easy greedy and one was parsing, like the httpserver questions, I did that one in python.

12. ### Interview Experience

> {{< collapse summary="Expand" >}}

The first round was a machine coding round, I was asked to design splitwise given a set of requirements. I solve this in cpp, remember to demonstrate good OOPs practices and at the same time make sure to pass the given testcases.

The second round was more of a connect and than an interview but it involved deep CV review and was inclined towards discussing my summer internship.
