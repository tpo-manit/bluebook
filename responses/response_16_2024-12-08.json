      "First two rounds were technical nature. In the first one they asked me the very first question from system design about designing a class for cars and then override that class to form and add specific functionalities such as types of brake, shape, etc.\n\nSecond question was simple DSA i.e. given two strings find that they are anagrams of each other or not.\n\nThird problem was from game design such that given 21 stick, the person who picks 21st stick will loose, a person can pick 1-4 sticks as per his intelligence on his turn. Code a program so that one person always wins.\n\nIn the second round, they asked me the implementation of priority queue data structure, asked me about projects and motive behind them, practical application of linked list data structure \n\nThird one was managerial interview, asked me about why do you want to join us, what makes you the best fit for the role, it was very conversational in nature."
